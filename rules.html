    <h2>How to Play</h2>

    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermind</a> is a code-breaking board game.
      The computer, or another player, generates a secret code consisting of a sequence of colored pegs.
      The number of colors available and the length of the sequence can be adjusted in the settings.
      The objective is to guess the secret code within a certain number of moves.
    </p>
    <p>
      After each guess, the player is awarded dark pegs and light pegs depending on how their guess compares to the secret code.
      These dark and light pegs are smaller than the colored pegs used in the secret code and guesses.
      The player gets a dark peg for each colored peg in their guess that is the correct color and is in the right location.
      The player gets a light peg for each colored peg in their guess that is the correct color but is in the wrong location.
      There is no indication about which small pegs correspond to which colored pegs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on the feedback of the small pegs, the player has to figure out the secret code.
      Note that each guess the player makes has to be full length.
      That is, they are not allowed to leave empty slots in their guess.
      As such, a secret code will never have unfilled slots either.
    </p>

    <h3>Single Player</h3>
    <p>
      In <em>Single Player</em>, the computer generates secret codes randomly.
      The player gets to be the code guesser.
    </p>

    <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
    <p>
      In <em>Multiplayer</em>, all players get to be a code guesser.
      Depending on the settings, the computer can randomly generate the same secret code for all players.
      Or, the players can make secret codes for each other.
      Who is assigned to make codes for who is randomly decided by the computer.
